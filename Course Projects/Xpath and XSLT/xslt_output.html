		<ul>
			<li>beef cube steak - 1.5 pound</li>
			<li>onion, sliced into thin rings - 1</li>
			<li>green bell pepper, sliced in rings - 1</li>
			<li>Italian seasoned bread crumbs - 1 cup</li>
			<li>grated Parmesan cheese - 0.5 cup</li>
			<li>olive oil - 2 tablespoon</li>
			<li>spaghetti sauce - 1 jar</li>
			<li>shredded mozzarella cheese - 0.5 cup</li>
			<li>angel hair pasta - 12 ounce</li>
			<li>minced garlic - 2 teaspoon</li>
			<li>butter - 0.25 cup</li>
		</ul><br /><strong>Preparation:</strong><br />
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
			</li>
			<li>
				Cut cube steak into serving size pieces. Coat meat with the bread crumbs
				and parmesan cheese. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, and saute 1
				teaspoon of the garlic for 3 minutes. Quick fry (brown quickly on both sides)
				meat. Place meat in a casserole baking dish, slightly overlapping edges.
				Place onion rings and peppers on top of meat, and pour marinara sauce
				over all.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on
				the thickness of the meat. Sprinkle mozzarella over meat and leave in the
				oven till bubbly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Boil pasta al dente. Drain, and toss in butter and 1 teaspoon garlic. For a
				stronger garlic taste, season with garlic powder. Top with grated parmesan
				and parsley for color. Serve meat and sauce atop a mound of pasta!
			</li>
		</ol><strong>Comment:</strong><br />
		Make the meat ahead of time, and refrigerate over night, the acid in the
		tomato sauce will tenderize the meat even more. If you do this, save the
		mozzarella till the last minute.
