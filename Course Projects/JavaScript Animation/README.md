# JavaScript Animation

A JavaScript program that moves a number of photos arround a court window. The photos bounce on the court borders and on each other.

The court is 1000x600px and the photos have width 80px, but the code works for any size of court, and any number and size of photos. The initial position of each photo is a random place inside the court. When we click on the court, photos start moving in random directions and random speeds. The photos bounce on the court sides and on each other. When we click on the court again, the animation is paused, when we click again, the animation resumes. So each time we click, it either pauses or resumes.
